# 🐍 Python Practice Scripts

This repository contains a structured collection of Python scripts created during my foundational learning phase. The code is organized into folders based on core topics like basic concepts, data structures, loops, and functions. Each file includes example code and notes to reinforce essential programming concepts.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🔹 `basic_concepts/`
Covers the fundamental building blocks of Python:
- Data types
- Operators
- Type conversion
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

### 🔹 `data_structures/`
Introduces Python's built-in data structures:
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries
- DataFrames (Pandas basics)

### 🔹 `loops_and_functions/`
Focuses on iterative and modular programming:
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- User-defined functions
- Function-based practice problems

## ✅ How This Repo Helps Me

- Reinforces concepts before I begin my Bachelor of IT (BIT) at UON via PSB Academy  
- Acts as a personal revision kit  
- Serves as the foundation for future GitHub projects in CS, AI, and Cybersecurity  
- Easy to share with peers, professors, or potential employers

## 🧠 What's Next?

- [ ] Add more scripts as I learn advanced concepts  
- [ ] Start new folders like `file_handling`, `error_handling`, `OOP`  
- [ ] Upload mini-projects using Python + GitHub
